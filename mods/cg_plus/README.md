Crafting Guide Plus is a simple and intuitive crafting guide and auto-crafting mod for Minetest. CGP is compatible with
Minetest Game and any other games that use sfinv. It was built mostly from the ground up, with some inspiration from
jp's Crafting Guide, Unified Inventory, and Minetest Game's builtin crafting guide.

Note: If `mtg_craftguide` is present, CGP will override its page in the inventory. You may want to remove
`mtg_craftguide` entirely for optimization purposes.

## Features:

- "Intelligent" auto-crafting, or rather, automatic craft staging.
- Shaped and shapeless crafting recipe previews of any size.
- Fuel and cooking recipes, including fuel replacements and burning/cooking times.
- Digging and digging by chance (item drop) previews.
- Group support, including group search (try searching `group:wood` in the craft guide) and support for craft recipes
  requiring items in one or more groups.
- Various settings for server owners

## For Mod/Game Developers

For information on the Crafting Guide Plus API and other tips for modders, see [developer_docs.md](developer_docs.md).

## Known issues:

- The auto-crafting algorithm is not *perfect*. For craft recipes requiring items in a group, only the item with the
  greatest count from the player's inventory will be utilized.
- Items in multiple groups will not always display correctly in craft view.
